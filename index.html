        <p>Hello World! Nyob zoo! Sawadee krap! Welcome to my page. My name is Tsimnuj Hawj. It's pronounced "Chee-New Her". However, you can call me "T". Language is very important to me. I can speak 2.5 languages, three if you include HTML and CSS!</p>
        <p>Language is important to me because it allows me to communicate with other people. That's a powerful tool to have, which is why I am working very diligently and hard to become a web developer. I didn't always know I wanted to be a web developer. I always thought I would travel the world and live a life of extreme hedonistic pursuit seeking out the truths of life and of earth. Who doesn't want to do that, right? However, I always knew I love languages and I had a deep interest in creativity and logic.</p>
        <p>It all started when I was 13-years old. I had an old donated computer from my cousin and I would spend hours upon hours on that machine playing a game called <a href="http://www.synthetic-reality.com/wosHome.htm"/>Well of Souls</a>. It was a tiny 2D online RPG game built with C++. When I was playing it back in 2002-2005, there were only about 200-300 players on a busy Friday night. The community was small, but it was a very tight-knit group of diverse players. This game consumed most of my adoloscent years because I guess I was sort of an awkward teenager. At the time I also played a lot of Final Fantasy, back when the series was still good. I must have completed Final Fansty 7, 8, and 9 five times each!</p>

        <figcaption>Well of Souls. Our character is in combat with a goblin and a crab!</figcaption>
        </figure>
        <p>What I really liked about the Final Fantasy series was the characters. They were all unique, although prototypical to Japanese melodrama, but they were what made the games interesting and engaging and as an angst-y teenager I related to them. This inspiration lead me to express creativity through Well of Souls. Well of Souls wasn't just a game you played, it had a powerful tool that allowed you to create your own "World" that you could share with the community and unlike some of the elaborate RPG Makers and game tools on the market where you could drag-n-drop, Well of Souls' worlds could only be built using a coding language exclusive to the game. Every interaction had to be scripted and this was a daunting task for the 13-year old me. I had no experience with programming and didn't know where to start, especially since the game wasn't known so there weren't any tutorials on YouTube or Google for me to reference. I had to learn the hard way: read other people's code, replicate it, and through trial and error, learn what did what and how to do it.</p>
        <p>The first World I built was simple. It had a lot of Final Fantasy and Dragonball Z influences. I called it Dragon's Heart and the story was about your journey to conquer the Four Elemental Dragons that ruled the world and as I began to get comfortable with the language, I started introducing new systems and the one I desperately wanted to incorporate was a "party system", like in Final Fantasy. I wanted to create characters that paid homage to my friends on Well of Souls. Now, the game had a pet system that many other World Developers tweaked for a party system, but I thought of it as lazy. I wanted more customization and control and the pet system didn't allow you that. So I began building the first ever party system in Well of Souls. There wasn't a lot of competition or breakthrough since the player base was so small. It was the perfect place for me to gain some confidence and knowledge.</p>

        <figcaption>Sample of Well of Souls code. No fancy text editors, only good ol' Notepad.</figcaption>
        </figure>
        
        <p>I spent the next few weeks after school and the weekends working on this system. I was determined. Even if I never finish the game, I promised myself I would finish the party system. I struggled, terribly. I asked for help from the developers of "Revolution of Terror" (RoT), the second most played World only after the default world of Evergreen and the team basically told me it was impossible and that it wasn't worth it and I should just use the pet system. I ignored their advice and continued this process of writing, debugging, rewriting, trashing, and starting all over again for about a month and a half.</p>
        <p>Eventually, after a month and a half of skipping my homework, going pale from lack of sunlight, screaming at the computer screen, and pounding my head against the table I made a fully functioning customizable party system. The character would gain a certain percentage of the experience you gained in combat towards gaining levels and skills. It allowed you to equip him with weapons and armors to boost his stats. He could interact with NPCs and other online players. He had a backstory, un-fleshed but still prominent. It was the greatest feeling in the world completing that project. I wanted to build something and I did it, all by myself with little resource and practically no help. I shared the World with my friends and they played around with it for a few days and it was quickly forgotten, but it didn't matter to me that no one seemed to care about it. I accomplished this thing and now I know how to do it. Through the entire process, I realized that the joy of coding wasn't the finished product. It was the process.</p>
        <p>Many of the World Developers knew other programming languages and would sometimes refer to it in the community forum or in-game. I was intrigued, but didn't know where to start because at the time there wasn't Udemy, FreeCodeCamp, Odin Project, or other coding resources available. Besides, at the time I didn't know that programming could be a job. I thought it was just something people did for fun. I was 13-years old! I just wanted to play computer games and kiss girls. Well, I'm not 13-years old anymore, but that desire to create is still there. The logic behind how codes interact is still a nature of mine.</p>

        <p>I graduated from Augsburg College in 2015 with a Bachelor of Arts in English and right after graduation I went to Thailand for a year to teach English at a school in Khon Kaen. While teaching and traveling through Southeast Asia I got to discover my love for travel, food, art, and self-reliance. When I returned I began working at a non-profit in Saint Paul teaching English to adults and although I enjoy teaching in the non-profit sector I realized there isn't any room for growth and I found myself being bored of my work. That's when I began using my downtime to study HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. I didn't just rediscover my love for coding, I discovered that I could do this for a living.</p>

        <figcaption>My last day in Thailand I went to the Wat Nong Wang temple and climbed all the way to the top.</figcaption>
        </figure>
        
        <p>Thankfully, thanks to Facebook's ad targeting algorithms (I search stuff on web development, a lot), Facebook recommended me the University of Minnesota's Coding Boot Camp. I had researched a lot about boot camps before and thought it fit my situation. I have a undergraduate degree already, I don't want to attend a two year web dev curriculum at a community college, and I am already learning programming on my own. I thought these things made me a great candidate for a boot camp. So I applied and I got accepted. If I wasn't in a boot camp, I would still be learning programming on my own, which is how I know programming is for me. I am excited to be making this positive change in my life and with grit, patience, and hard work, I know that I will be successful.</p>

            <h1 id="h1-about">Thoughts on Thai Food and Pepper</h1>
            <hr>
            
            <figure class="float-left">
                    <a href="assets/images/street_food.jpg" target="_blank"><img class="img-resize" src="assets/images/street_food.jpg"/></a>
                    <figcaption>This food stall is run by a mother and her son. They spend four hours each day to cook and prepare this array of food. Seven days a week. An order of each item is only 30 baht, which is about $0.89. Better than a McChicken if you ask me!</figcaption>
            </figure>

            <p>The Thai eating habit is to order plenty and eat slow.
            <p>Khon Kaen is one of the major four cities in Northeast Thailand. It is best known as Isan. Isan is bordered by the Mekong River (along the border of Laos) to the north and east. To the south, Isan is border with Cambodia. Because of its close proximity to Laos the food is heavily influenced by the spices, herbs, meats and cooking methods of Laos. In fact, many of the people here do not recognized themselves as Thai ethnics. They identify themselves as Isan people, although their modern culture is heavily Thai driven.</p>    
            <p>Which is the reason why cooking at home is uncommon. Bangkok is known for its culinary artistry, however praises from foodies are often aimed at the street food. Which is plentiful across Thailand. It is one of the the main source of income for most people. Second only to the red light district in Bangkok, interestingly enough, most women in the red light district are from Isan.</p>     
            <p>Street food is inexpensive, accessible and delicious.</p>
            
            <figure class="float-right">
                    <a href="assets/images/peppers.jpg" target="_blank"><img class="img-resize" src="assets/images/peppers.jpg"/></a>
                    <figcaption>Chili flakes I picked up at a street market. Pet maak maak! (Very very spicy)</figcaption>
            </figure>

            <p>The main trait of Isan food is the generous usage of Bird’s Eye Chili (Thai chili). Chili is used to spice almost all dishes. If a dish is too plain, add some pickled pepper sauce. If a dish is too sweet, add some pepper flakes. If a dish is too sour, add some fried peppers. You get the idea.</p>
            <p>Because of the spicy nature of the food, it is often balanced with fresh herbs and vegetables. Basil, cilantro, green onion, ginger, galangal, napa cabbage, lemon grass, long beans, water spinach and cucumbers are only a sample of the assortment of vegetables and herbs found in Isan dishes.</p>
            
            <figure class="float-left">
                    <a href="assets/images/gai_yang.jpg" target="_blank"><img class="img-resize" src="assets/images/gai_yang.jpg"/></a>
                    <figcaption>Gai yang grilling on the side of the street. Coconut shells are sometimes used as charcoal to cook, creating a sweet flavor.</figcaption>
            </figure>

            <p>The meats most commonly consumed in Isan is fish and chicken. Fish can be prepared by deep frying until it is golden and crispy. A concoction of herbs and spices are prepared ahead of time to dress the fish before serving. It can also be chopped and boiled as a spicy and sour soup called tom yum. Tom yum is some times made with coconut milk and chili paste (found in other regions), but the Isan style is a clear broth decorated with peppers and a variety of basils. Chicken can be found grilled (Gai Yang) (the best chicken I have ever had). It can also be made into tom yum or khao poon.</p>
            <p>A very popular Thai/Laotian dish is som tum (papaya salad). It is a spicy, sour, and sometimes pungent salad made up of green papaya, fish sauce, chili, lime, tomatoes, garlic, tamarind paste, crab brine (Lao style) and sugar. It is ordered at almost every meal.</p>
 
            <figure class="float-right">

                    <figcaption>Papaya salad, sticky rice, gai yang, and chili sauce. The sauce wasn't spicy enough for my taste, so I added some of the flakes from above to it.</figcaption>
            </figure>
 
            <p>Rice is a staple dish, and unless you are eating at a noodle shop, one of two types of rice dishes (sticky or steamed) will be ordered to accompany the side dishes. The Thai phrase for “eat food” is “kin khaw”, which literally translates to “eat rice”. Rice is the main dish.</p>
            <p>It is customary to order a plethora of dishes to share with your table. Family style. Responsibility of ordering falls upon the inviter of the guests. He/she will order rice, a soup, papaya salad, and one or two different dishes. Usually a fish and/or laab (meat salad). Everyone eats slowly and stops when they are full. It is rare that all dishes are completely eaten. And no one ever box up the leftovers, even when only one half of a tilapia was eaten.</p>
            <p>The habit of eating small portions and eating it slow may come from…you guessed it, the pepper! Capsaicin, the heat molecule from chili, has many health benefits.</p>
            <ul>
                <li>The first of this is that it helps body temperature. Capsaicin makes us feel hotter than we actually are. Which promotes sweating and circulation. And in return helps the body lower its temperature.</li>
                <li>Spicy food helps moderate caloric intake. The heat from chili stimulates brain chemicals that signals fullness. Which explains why after a few bites of papaya salad, I’m ready for dessert!</li>
                <li>Capsaicin boosts metabolism. Maybe that’s why I don’t see too many overweight Thai people!</li>
                <li>Helps healthy hearts. “cultures around the world that use hot peppers liberally in their meals have significantly lower rates of heart attack and stroke than cultures that do not.”</li>
            </ul>
            <p>I believe that a combination of this diet along with regular exercise can be a hot one! <strong>Read more below!</strong></p>
